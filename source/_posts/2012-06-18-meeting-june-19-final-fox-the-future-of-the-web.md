Its time to enter a whole new realm of Internet challenge and adventure.

It is no secret that Mozilla has been pushing the boundaries of what the internet is capable of, and has been a fundamental force in evolving the web. This month will be a whirlwind tour of a host of exciting topics that encompass the vast and magical things that Mozilla has in store for everone.
