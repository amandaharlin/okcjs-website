## This Month

Meeting November 27, 2012 @The Exchange

### Prototype warriors.


"Prototype Warriors"

## About our Speakers

### Dennis Ferron

I'm a graduate of the computer science program from Southwestern Oklahoma State University. I have worked in the software industry writing business software, and also participated in an undergraduate research program in machine learning and artificial intelligence. I did an engineering intership with NASA at the Johnson Space Center in Houston.  I currently work as a .NET developer for Love's Country Stores and Travel Stops.

### Jonathan Camenisch

I help build the web. Or, more specifically, I do full-stack web programming* projects for large and small businesses (and some for fun). I also have experience applying various technologies to business strategy, and I enjoy helping in brainstorming of every kind.
