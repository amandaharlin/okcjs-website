### The Making Of A Javascript Game.


##"Wait.... You Can Make Games With Javascript  ?" 

Dude. Yes you can.

Some developers from right here in Oklahoma are doing it right now. James Simpson and Luke Simpkins of Goldfire Studios have managed to create a vast, persistent virtual world that you can enjoy with javascript. The game is accessible anywhere using the latest Html 5 technologies, right in your browser, phone, tablet or any other modern device.

You can't miss this next meeting. You'll have an opportunity to listen to some talented developers talk about their experiences in this technology stack, their experiences in the game industry, and how they have dealt with many common, and possibly not-so-common issues with client-stack game development.
