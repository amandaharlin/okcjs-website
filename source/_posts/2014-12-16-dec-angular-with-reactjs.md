## About our Speaker

### Jesse Harlin

I work as a Javascript application architect at Telogical Systems where I work with an awesome team making cutting edge web applications. When I’m not doing this, I am very active in the local technology community. I help run the Oklahoma City Javascript Usergroup, Techlahoma and co-organize Thunder Plains, one of Oklahoma’s most relevant Javascript and web technology conferences.
I love my wife, performing puppet shows for the blind, and building cool stuff with Javascript.
